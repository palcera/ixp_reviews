## IXP process documentation for a new Company Admin user requesting a coupon code

1. When a user registers as a "Company Admin", they have the ability to create or join a company. 
2. Admin (Carlos) receives email notification about new user. If new user requests the "company admin" role", Carlos has the option to forward the request to an IXP company reviewer volunteer. This person has the ability to approve the user by reviewing the user profile and their company profile.  
3. The new user gets a "welcome" email. Once they login, on their company page they'll have the option to "Request a coupon code for jobs.drupal.org". When they click this, an email will be sent to the admin (Carlos) who will then email the DA requesting a coupon code. 
4. When the coupon code is received, there will be a place for the admin (Carlos) to enter the coupon code where it will be sent to the user as well as visible to the user on their company dashboard.
